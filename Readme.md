I am developing a mobile-first, responsive frontend for a photography website using React and Flux. The goal is to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. 

Key requirements:
- Ensure all images are responsive and optimized for mobile devices.
- Implement measures to prevent image downloads.
- Use a sample website as a reference to guide the design and functionality of the frontend.

This project is intended for a professional photographer, so the design should reflect a high standard of quality and creativity.
